## 👋 Hi, I’m @alexajoyce, I work at the border of tech, skills and education
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science and technical education, working with universities and colleges, and making CS more accessible to people around the world. I'm not a developer but I have done some basic coding and taken a ton of industry certs. I can pretty much build a chat bot or use no code tools to run image classification. I'm proud of my small steps
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI/ML, I just passed my Microsoft AI Engineer cert.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ways to make CS better in higher ed!
- 📫 How to reach me - find me on Twitter @alexajoyce
