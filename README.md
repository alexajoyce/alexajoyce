## 👋 Hi, I’m @alexajoyce, I work at the intersection of tech, skills and education
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science and technical education, working with universities and colleges, and making CS more accessible to people around the world. I'm not a developer but I have done some basic coding and taken a ton of industry certs. I can pretty much build a chat bot or use no code tools to run image classification. I'm proud of my small steps! 
- 👩🏿‍🎓 So why am I encouraging CS education if I'm not a developer myself? I missed out on CS education as when as I was at school, we didn't learn any CS or even get encouraged to think about it as a career. I want to make sure others have the opportunity to get deep into CS to make it more inclusive, equitable and build an awesome digital future for everyone.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI/ML, I just passed my Microsoft AI Engineer cert.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ways to make CS better in higher ed! Research tells us that we need more hands on CS education, connected to solving real world challenges, and using industry-ready CS tools to make it easier for graduates to move into jobs, while also making CS more inclusive and attractive to all.
